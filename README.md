# nadi.sdk

A python SDK to build CLI tools to fetch data from anywhere. Not fully conformant but inspired from [Singer Spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md). 


- 🚀 Build tools to fetch data from any API source in minutes.
- 🔁 Have a consistent experience across all tools built from nadi SDK.
